Step 1: Data Import and Preparation

Step 2: Opened the Excel file containing the sales data for the years 2015, 2016, and 2017-2018.

Step 3: Checked for data consistency, ensuring all sales figures were numeric and the date column was in proper date format.

Step 4: Created new columns to extract the Year and Month from the Date column using Excel formulas =YEAR(Date) and =MONTH(Date) to facilitate year-wise and month-wise analysis.

### Visualization 1 - Average Sales in Each Year by the State (Stacked Column Chart) Step 5: Aggregated the data by Year and State.

Step 6: Used Pivot Tables to calculate the average sales for each state for each year.

Step 7: Created a Stacked Column Chart to show the comparative average sales for each state across the years 2015, 2016, and 2017-2018.

Step 8: Each state's sales were represented as a stacked section of the column, providing a clear comparison of performance year-over-year.

### Visualization 2 - Top Five Suburb Groups from 2016 to 2017 (Clustered Bar Chart)

Step 9: Filtered the dataset to include only the sales data from 2016 to 2017.

Step 10: Grouped the data by Suburb Group and summed the sales for each suburb over the period.

Step 11: Sorted the suburbs by total sales and extracted the top five highest-performing suburb groups.

Step 12: Created a Clustered Bar Chart to represent the sales of the top five suburbs, showing the performance of each suburb for 2016-2017.

### Visualization 3 - Top 10 Average Sales by Category from 2016 to 2018 (Stacked Area Chart).

Step 13: Aggregated the data by Category and calculated the average sales for each category from 2016 to 2018.

Step 14: Ranked the categories based on their average sales figures and extracted the top 10.

Step 15: Created a Stacked Area Chart, which allowed me to visualize how each of the top 10 categories contributed to total sales over the three years.

Step 20: Filtered the data by year and aggregated the sales data by day.

Step 21: Ranked the days within each year by total sales and identified the top five days with the highest sales.

### Visualization 6 - Percentage of Sales by Each Month (Line Chart).

Step 23: Aggregated the sales data by month for each year, summing the total sales for each month.

Step 24: Calculated the percentage contribution of each month’s sales to the total sales of that year, using the formula: Percentage Sales=Monthly SalesTotal Sales for Year×100\text{Percentage Sales} = \frac{\text{Monthly Sales}}{\text{Total Sales for Year}} \times 100.

Step 25: Created a Line Chart to show the percentage of total sales that each month contributed, helping to visualize monthly sales trends and seasonality.
